How do I approach designing software?
I first picture it in my head and then I try to get it on paper. Either hand draing or with a program. As I am putting it on paper I will think about how the softwaree will run and how user will interact with it.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
The new skills in this class has allowed me to take a 2D image and recreate it as a 3D scnene. It has also enabled me to be able to navigate wihin that scene.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
After taking the image, I needed to break up the image into smaller sections that I could create. Taking each object as its own part helped to make creation easier.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Any of the tactics could be applied in the future. If you have a large project to complete, divide it into parts and focus solely one one part at a time.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
One new strategy that worked for this project was being able to see and touch the object I was creating. It helped me understand why movie animators will create a real life model for their characters.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
While I knew at the beginning of this project that it helps you to keep code in different files and headers, it didn't really make sense on how much it helped. This is one of the bigger projects I have worked on as far as amount of code. Not having everything in one file really helped to keep me on track and not get lost on what I was trying to do.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
considering I am trying to make using computer science into a career, I would say it is the major help to reaching my goals. I am currently working as a parts clerk ordering parts and paying invoices. I would like to leave my current job and work for a company that creates games or animations. I am hoping to work my way into designing. Knowing how a programmer would use my designs will help me to create them better.
